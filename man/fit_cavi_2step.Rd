\title{Fit CAVI with automatic factor selection (2-step)}
\usage{
fit_cavi_2step(Y_list, post_fit0 = NULL, k = NULL, j_s = NULL, cutoff = 0.05, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y_list}{List of S study matrices (each \code{n_s x P}).}
\item{post_fit0}{Optional post-processed initial fit (from \code{postprocess_cavi()}). If provided, the initial fit stage is skipped.}
\item{k}{Initial number of common factors (required if \code{post_fit0} is \code{NULL}).}
\item{j_s}{Initial study-specific factor counts (required if \code{post_fit0} is \code{NULL}).}
\item{cutoff}{Eigen-proportion cutoff passed to \code{select_k_from_sigma()}.}
\item{...}{Passed to \code{fit_cavi()} for both stages.}
}
\value{Post-processed output of the refit (same structure as \code{postprocess_cavi()}).}
\description{
Convenience wrapper that (i) fits an initial CAVI model, (ii) selects factor counts from covariance components, and (iii) refits with the selected counts.
